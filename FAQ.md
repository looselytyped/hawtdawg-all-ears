## Where do I list my favorite treats?
Open the Hawt Dawg app and click on "Edit Profile." 
Scroll down to the section called "Passions" and tell 
potential mates and friends all about the treats and toys 
that make your tail wag. 
When you’re done, click "Save Changes" to show the world.
## Photos are nice and all, but I don’t see very well. How can 
I smell the other dogs?
We regret that we are unable to offer our customers smell-o￾vision at this time. 
As soon as human technology catches up to dog noses, we’ll be 
sure to add a scent feature to the app. 
In the meantime, why not meet up at the dog park to get a whiff 
of your new friend?
