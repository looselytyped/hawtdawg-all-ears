## where do I list my favorite treats?

Open the Gawt Dawg app and click on "Edit Profile."

Scroll down to the section called "Passions" and tell
potential mates and friends all about the treats and toys
that make your tail wag.

When you're done, click "Save Changes" to show the world.

## Photos are nice and all, byt I don't see very well. How can I smell the other dogs?
