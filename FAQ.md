# FAQ

## Where do I list my favorite treats?

## How many photos can I post?


We know you want to show off your fabulous furry face, so we’ve given you
space to upload up to 15 photos!
For those who are camera-shy, we recommend posting at least one to bring
your profile some attention.
Showcase your best self—whether that means a fresh-from-the-groomer glamour
shot or an action shot from your last game of fetch

## Photos are nice and all, but I don’t see very well. How can
I smell the other dogs?
We regret that we are unable to offer our customers smell-ovision at this time.
As soon as human technology catches up to dog noses, we’ll be
sure to add a scent feature to the app.
In the meantime, why not meet up at the dog park to get a whiff
of your new friend?
